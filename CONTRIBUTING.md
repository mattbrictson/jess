# Contributing to Jess

Have a feature idea, bug fix, or refactoring suggestion? Contributions are welcome! Here are some general guidelines.

## Discuss first!

1. Check [Issues][] to see if your contribution has already been discussed and/or implemented.
2. If not, open an issue to discuss your contribution. I won't accept all changes and do not want to waste your time.
3. Once you have the :thumbsup:, fork the repo, make your changes, and open a PR.

## Before you commit

* Did you add tests? New features or changes in behavior should be tested.
* Do all tests and RuboCop checks pass? Run `bundle exec rake` to be sure.
* Did you add a CHANGELOG entry? All non-trivial PRs need one.

## Questions?

Need help writing an appropriate test? Not sure the best way to attack a problem? Please ask by [posting a GitHub issue][Issues]!
